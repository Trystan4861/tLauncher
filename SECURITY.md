At this stage, tLauncher is in early development, and no official versions have been released yet. Security updates will be considered once an initial stable release is available.

# Reporting a Vulnerability
If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

Do not disclose it publicly before an official fix is available.
Report it privately by opening a security issue or contacting the maintainers directly.
Provide as much detail as possible, including steps to reproduce the issue.
We appreciate responsible disclosure and will work to resolve vulnerabilities as soon as possible.

# Future Security Considerations
Once the project reaches a stable release, we will define security update policies.
Best practices for secure development will be adopted progressively.
Thank you for helping to make tLauncher a safe and reliable project!
